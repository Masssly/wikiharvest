# WikiHarvest: Toolkit for Curated Wikimedia Dataset Creation

## Overview
WikiHarvest is an open-source toolkit designed to democratize access to Wikimedia data by simplifying the creation of research-ready datasets from Wikipedia and Wikidata. Our mission is to bridge the technical gap that prevents researchers, linguists, and small teams from leveraging these vast knowledge repositories.

## The Problem
Wikimedia projects contain incredible amounts of data, but:
- Raw data dumps require significant technical expertise to process
- Researchers waste time building duplicate extraction tools
- Communities studying underrepresented languages face steep technical barriers
- Existing tools don't provide end-to-end dataset creation workflows

## Our Solution
WikiHarvest provides:
- **User-friendly interfaces** for filtering and extracting data
- **Modular processing pipelines** for cleaning and transforming content
- **Standardized export formats** (CSV, JSONL) for immediate analysis
- **Both CLI and web GUI** options for different user preferences

## Target Users
- Linguistics researchers studying low-resource languages
- Digital humanities scholars
- Small NGOs and community organizations
- Developers building tools on Wikimedia data

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with mwxml, pandas, and custom Wikidata processors
- **Interfaces**: CLI (click framework) + Web GUI (Streamlit)
- **Packaging**: Docker for easy deployment
- **Data Formats**: Support for Wikimedia XML dumps and Wikidata JSON dumps

## Current Status
*This project is currently in active planning. We expect to begin implementation in June 2026.*

## Roadmap
### 6-Month Development Phase
1. Architecture design and requirement analysis
2. Wikipedia text extraction module
3. Wikidata entity extraction module  
4. Data cleaning pipelines and export functionality
5. User interfaces (CLI + Web GUI)
6. Documentation and pilot testing

### 4-Month Second Stage (Planned)
- Community workshops and training
- Academic paper submission
- Conference presentations
- Sustainability planning
